# Ideas for writing (future things)
1. Roll of approximations in physics
2. Dimensional analysis
3. Typical/natural scales and solving hard problems
4. Story telling and the physical world
5. Statistics: errors. What do error bars actually mean? Distributions, small samples, cosmic variance, people are bad at assessing problems that aren't (100, 50, 0)%
6. Why astro? Everything that we learn in our course is actually true and how we know
7. Guide to stargazing
8. My route through undergrad, how my interests have changed/surprised me
9. Guide to letters

# Questions from LS students after talk
1. What is a BH?
2. EHT, M87, SagA*
3. How do we know what time different things happen in the early universe?
4. How do we know that other things don't cause microwaves we see in the CMB (foregrounds and my summer project)
5. Upper limit on BH mass?
6. What happened before BB/what's outside the universe?
7. Fate of the universe
8. Aliens and astrobiology
9. How do people in your field deal with the fact that you'll never have all the answers?
