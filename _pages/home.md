# Welcome!

I am a PhD researcher at Newcastle University, studying the large scale structure of the Universe and dark matter dynamics. This is my personal website designed to host all information about my research, projects, and other interests in one central place. You can find out more [about me]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/about), about [my research]({ site.baseurl }}/research) which includes some slides and videos of scientific talks, and [my outreach and teaching endeavours]({ site.baseurl }}/outreach). This website is still very much a work in progress so be patient if you don't see something you expect to, or if one of the pages looks weird!

I'm planning on showcasing various bits of writing that I do on my [blog]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/recent/index.html). In future I may list typed versions of lecture notes or technical projects separate from the blog, but we'll see what time allows.
