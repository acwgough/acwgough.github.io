# Welcome!

I am a PhD researcher at Newcastle University, studying the large scale structure of the Universe and dark matter dynamics. For more about me and my research, click [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/about). This website is designed to host all of my work in one place. It is still very much a work in progress so be patient if you don't see something you expect to!

I'm planning on showcasing various bits of writing that I do on my [blog]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/recent/index.html). In future I may list typed versions of lecture notes or technical projects separate from the blog.
