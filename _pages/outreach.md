I am passionate about scientific outreach and education. I have previous experience presenting scientific material to both children and adults in the context of school talks, science museum presenting, public science outreach events, and scientific talks. I'm also a regular author for the [Astrobites](https://astrobites.org/) collaboration, which writes daily posts on current astronomy research. If you'd like me to give a talk about something, or if you have an idea for an outreach/teaching project you'd like to collaborate on, please reach out to me [by email](mailto:a.gough2@ncl.ac.uk).
