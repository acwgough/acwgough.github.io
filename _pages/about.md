I am a masters student studying mathematical and theoretical physics at Oxford University. My interests are in cosmology and the extreme scales of the Universe. I'm also interested in science communication and education. I write about things that interest me in my blog.

I'm also interested in photography and Taekwon-do. In future I may showcase some of those things on this website as well.
