![headshot](/assets/images/headshot.JPG){: .align-left} I'm a first year PhD student at Newcastle University. Formally my PhD is in mathematics, but at heart I'm a physicist, and my research is focused on understanding the large scale structure of the Universe. In particular I study dark matter dynamics in the non-linear regime, and work on using and developing new statistical techniques for extracting cosmological information. My supervisor is [Cora Uhlemann](https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/corauhlemann/). You can read more about what our research group does on the [cosmology page](https://blogs.ncl.ac.uk/cosmology/) or the [observational astrophysics](https://blogs.ncl.ac.uk/astro-obs/) page.

I received my masters degree from Oxford university where I did both my undergraduate degree and the Mathematical and Theoretical Physics [(MMathPhys)](https://mmathphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/) course. During this course I took courses on general relativity, cosmology, quantum field theory, galactic dynamics, radiative processes, group theory, and differential geometry.

I'm also interested in education, both of science and more generally. I enjoy teaching and writing, and have experience working directly with both students and the public. I'm interested in science as a human endeavour, and how the communication of science can benefit from and interface with different media such as storytelling and art. I write about things that interest me in [my blog](/recent/index.html).

I'm also interested in photography and Taekwon-do. In future I may showcase some of those things on this website as well. Unless otherwise credited all photos/diagrams on this website are by me.
