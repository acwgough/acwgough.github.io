I am a masters student studying mathematical and theoretical physics at Oxford University. My research interests are in cosmology and the extreme scales of the Universe. In particular I'm interested in how cosmology can inform our understanding of fundamental physics, and in how we can extract the maximum amount of information out of minimal data. I'm interested in understanding the assumptions that go into the standard models being used, and how these can be robustly tested.

I'm also interested in education, both of science and more generally. I enjoy teaching and writing, and have experience working directly with both students and the public. I'm interested in science as a human endeavour, and how the communication of science can benefit from and interface with different media such as storytelling and art. I write about things that interest me in [my blog](/recent/index.html).

I'm also interested in photography and Taekwon-do. In future I may showcase some of those things on this website as well.
