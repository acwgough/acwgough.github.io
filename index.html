<h1>Welcome!</h1>

I am a masters student studying theoretical and mathematical physics at Oxford University. For more about me, click <a href="about/">here</a>. This website is designed to host all of my work in one place. 

I'm planning on showcasing various bits of writing that I do on my <a href="recent/index.html">blog</a>. In future I may list typed versions of lecture notes or technical projects separate from the blog.
