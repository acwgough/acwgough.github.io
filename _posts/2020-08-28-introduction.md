Hello! This is my first blog post, here just to test the functionality of this website. I am planning on adding more here as I go, but transitioning between degrees, attending a conference, and the general state of the world during a pandemic has limited both my energy and time to write.

LaTeX functionality should be up and running now, so I can type inline equations as $E=mc^2$ and equations on their own lines as

$$
G_{\mu\nu} = R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}R g_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G T_{\mu \nu}.
$$

Some topics I anticipate writing about in the near future either here or on my [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/acwgough) (or both) are:
* an introduction to my research topic (nonlinear structure formation)
* a series on statistics problems I think are interesting and illuminate a lot about how we think
* what my goals in science communication and education are
* why I study astronomy
* what my path through undergrad looked like: what I enjoyed, what I didn't, and how my interests changed
* answering questions I received from high school students after my presentation on "A Brief History of the Universe" (including black holes, how we know when things happened in cosmology, and the fate of the universe)
* and much much more!

Hold tight for more to come, I'm hoping to start actually getting through this list very soon.
