Starting this year, I will be writing for [Astrobites](https://astrobites.org), a collaboration of graudate students in astronomy around the world who write about current research in astronomy. The backbone of Astrobites is their [daily research summaries](https://astrobites.org/category/daily-paper-summaries/) which are posted every day and summarise recent research papers from the astro-ph section of arXiv to make learning about cutting edge research more accessible. Astrobites recently celebrated their 10th birthday, and have grown an enormous amount since they started. In recent years there has been a large emphasis on writing series of posts on things [beyond daily summaries](https://astrobites.org/beyond-astro-ph-library/), which is a really great project and use of their large and growing platform. I particularly enjoyed reading and sharing posts from their #BlackInAstro, LGBTQ+, Women in Astro, and mental health series, but they also have written great posts on navigating careers in academia, how different application processes work, and how to transition from being taught to doing research.

I started reading Astrobites' summary posts shortly after they started coming out, I think I found their sister site ParticleBites first (back when I thought that high energy physics was all the rage), though Astrobites actually predates ParticleBites by 3 years. I cannot remember what originally turned my on to finding them, but it likely has to do with my good fortune of growing up nearby Harvard (where Astrobites started), and having the opportunity, funds, and time, to attend a few courses there where I met people who were probably involved with its inception. Whatever the cause, I've been voraciously reading them since I was in high school, and now I'm actually doing research and reading the papers as they come out, I hope I can help contribute to the awe and understanding of some unsuspecting young scientists.

I will be cross posting all my astrobites articles to my blog here, as well as the Newcastle Observational Astrophysics group blog. I may end up posting a series of "Astrobites Extended" posts on my blog here, where I write more about the papers than would be appropriate for a single daily summary post.
